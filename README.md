# iiSU-PC Setup

Runs iiSU (an Android emulation frontend) inside a Windows-hosted Android VM, patched so launching a game in iiSU hands off to a real PC emulator instead of an Android one.

**This does not include iiSU itself.** iiSU is closed-source, third-party software this project has no affiliation with -- you need your own copy of its APK. This tool patches *your* copy, the same way any APK-patching/modding tool works; it never bundles or redistributes iiSU's binary.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- A JDK on PATH (`java` and `keytool` need to work from a terminal) -- e.g. [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/)
- Python 3.11+
- Your own copy of the iiSU APK
- Whichever PC emulators you actually want to use (DuckStation, Dolphin, PCSX2, etc.) -- install these yourself
- A few GB of free disk space and a decent internet connection (first run downloads the Android SDK + a system image)
- **CPU VIRTUALIZATION MUST BE TURNED ON!** Do this in your bios. 

## First-time setup

1. Drop your iiSU APK into `installer/input/`, or just point Setup at it with Browse.
2. Run **`iiSU-PC Manager.bat`** (in `bridge/`) and click **Run Setup** on its Home page.

Setup checks your APK is actually iiSU and that you have enough disk space, then downloads and sets up a self-contained Android SDK and virtual device, patches your APK, installs it, installs a redirector app for every console `shared/emulator_defaults.py` knows about, and creates a desktop shortcut. It shows which step it's on, since first run can take a while and several GB.

Once it's done, a short onboarding wizard walks you through your ROM directory, emulator search folders, display resolution, and hotkeys. The Manager's settings pages are there afterward for anything the wizard doesn't cover, and its Home page switches from "Run Setup" to "Open" once setup finishes.

## Day to day use

Double-click the **desktop shortcut**, or run **`iiSU-PC Manager.bat`** (in `bridge/`) for the full Manager -- one window, navigated with the hamburger (☰) sidebar:

- **Home** -- AVD/bridge status, Open/Stop, a running status line, and quick buttons to your ROMs folder and logs.
- **ROM Directory**, **Emulators**, **Display**, **Advanced** -- everything `config.json` holds, saved with one Save button. Emulators has a "Test Selected..." button to check a mapping without starting the AVD. Advanced has a "Show console windows" checkbox for debugging.
- **Credits** -- who built this and how (see below).
- **Uninstall** -- below a divider at the bottom of the sidebar.

Every start checks for updates (`bridge/updater.py`) and re-syncs your ROM library into the VM automatically -- both are no-ops when there's nothing to do, so neither adds noticeable time on repeat starts. iiSU still needs to notice new games: hit "Rescan full library" in its Library settings.

A fullscreen overlay (`bridge/boot_overlay.py`) covers the AVD boot and the emulator hand-off, showing what's happening ("Booting iiSU-PC...", "Waiting on DuckStation...") instead of raw desktop. It's off while the debug console checkbox is on.

Inside the VM, tap **Escape** to force-quit the current game and return to iiSU (or close iiSU and shut down the VM entirely if nothing's running); hold it for 5s to always close iiSU and shut down the VM entirely, regardless of what's running (both the key and the hold duration are rebindable in Advanced, along with an optional separate full-shutdown combo). Holding **Back+Start** together on a controller for 2.5s does the same full shutdown.

## Uninstalling

Open the Manager's **Uninstall** page for a preview of exactly what will be removed and how much space it frees before you confirm. It removes the Android VM and its portable SDK copy, `bridge/config.json`, the signing keystore, and the desktop shortcut. It does not touch your ROM library, your PC emulators, or the iiSU APK you supplied. It also flags `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk`, which the SDK downloader can end up using -- left alone by default since a real Android Studio install would keep its own SDK there too.

## How it works, briefly

`installer/patch_iisu.py` decompiles your iiSU APK, redirects its ROM-launch code to a small injected class that sends the launch request to `bridge/launch_bridge.py` over a local socket, then rebuilds and signs it. The bridge matches the requested game to a PC emulator (configured in `bridge/config.json`) and launches it directly on Windows.

iiSU also needs to think a real emulator is installed for each console before it'll treat it as playable. Setup installs a placeholder "redirector" app for each one (`installer/stub_apk.py`) that does nothing itself, since the patched launch never reaches it. The Manager's Emulators page has an "Install Redirector Apps..." button to re-run this any time.

## Running tests

`python -m unittest discover -s tests` runs the unit tests covering the console/emulator routing logic (`shared/emulator_defaults.py`, `bridge/console_names.py`, `bridge/launch_bridge.py`'s `find_emulator_for_package`). Stdlib-only, no AVD or adb needed -- these only check the pure mapping/decision logic, not an actual end-to-end launch.

## If something breaks

- `installer/patch_iisu.py`'s patch is anchored on a specific log string in iiSU's code. If iiSU updates and changes it, the patch fails loudly instead of silently producing a broken build.
- `bridge/emulator.log`, `bridge/bridge.log`, and `bridge/stop.log` cover the AVD, the launch bridge, and shutdown respectively. Open the Manager's Home page (Logs button) to check them.
- Re-running setup is safe -- it skips anything already done and won't overwrite an existing `config.json`'s settings.
- The AVD always cold-boots and never keeps a resume snapshot, trading a bit of boot time for avoiding stale storage/mount state.
