"""
Applies config.json's "display" settings (width/height/density) to the AVD's
actual hardware profile and cold-boots it so the change takes effect.

gpu_mode is deliberately NOT handled here, unlike the others -- it's passed
straight to emulator.exe as a plain -gpu launch flag by start_iisu_pc.py
instead, since it's read fresh from config.json on every launch, so a
GPU-backend choice needs no dedicated "cold-boot to apply" cycle of its
own the way an actual hardware-profile change (resolution) does: it just
takes effect on the very next normal start, like every other config.json
setting already does.

This edits hw.lcd.width/height/density directly in the AVD's config.ini
rather than using the live `adb shell wm size` override: `wm size` only
resizes the logical pixel grid within the emulator's existing physical
panel shape, so going from a portrait phone profile to a landscape
resolution just letterboxes instead of giving a clean full-bleed display.
Changing the actual hardware profile requires a cold boot, but gives a
genuinely native resolution with no letterboxing.

Edits the *portable* AVD copy under android-sdk-portable/avd-home/ (see
portable_sdk.py) -- that's the one every real launch actually uses since
the portable-SDK migration, not ~/.android/avd/ (only ever a one-time copy
source). Restarts everything via stop_iisu_pc.main() + start_iisu_pc.main()
-- the same stop/start the control panel's own buttons use -- rather than
the `android emulator start/stop` CLI wrapper, which start_iisu_pc.py's own
docstring documents as hanging indefinitely once the AVD is actually up.
start_iisu_pc.main() also starts the launch bridge and brings iiSU to the
foreground itself (see launch_bridge.py's launch_iisu()), so this doesn't
need to duplicate that -- without it, display changes would leave the AVD
freshly booted but with no bridge running to redirect game launches.

Run this after changing display settings in manager.py's Display page.
