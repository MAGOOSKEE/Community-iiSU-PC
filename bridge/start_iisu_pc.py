"""
One-shot launcher for the whole Community-iiSU-PC setup: checks for updates to the
project itself (updater.py), then starts the AVD if it isn't already
running, then starts the launch bridge if it isn't already running.
Covers a cold boot with a fullscreen black overlay (boot_overlay.py) the
whole time, since the AVD's window isn't made fullscreen until well into
this sequence and would otherwise leave raw desktop visible around it.

This is the single entry point meant for day-to-day use -- it's what runs
when you click Open (or Stop -> Open again) on manager.py's Home page,
instead of manually starting the emulator and the bridge as separate
steps.

Note: this intentionally does NOT use the `android emulator start` wrapper.
That command promises to "return when the emulator is fully started," but
hangs forever even after the AVD is fully booted and usable: it launches
emulator.exe as a grandchild and captures its output via a pipe, and
emulator.exe (the long-lived VM process) inherits that pipe's write end, so
the pipe's read side never sees EOF -- subprocess.run() then blocks forever
waiting for output that will never stop. Launching emulator.exe directly,
detached and with output discarded (not piped), avoids the whole class of
problem, and we poll `adb devices` ourselves to know when it's ready.

It also always launches from the portable SDK/AVD copy under
android-sdk-portable/ (see portable_sdk.py) rather than the system-wide
Android Studio install -- see portable_sdk.py for why.

Always launches with -no-snapshot: a quickboot-resumed AVD carries its
mount/storage state forward from whenever the snapshot was captured,
which can go stale in ways a fresh boot doesn't hit (e.g. the emulated
SD card failing to (re)mount correctly). A real cold boot costs maybe
30-60s more; that's cheap insurance against a whole class of "why is my
storage broken" bug reports compared to a snapshot resume that's a few
seconds faster but occasionally wrong.
