"""
iiSU launch bridge.

Listens on the AVD's host-loopback address (10.0.2.2 from inside the emulator
== this machine, on the configured port) for the raw Intent dump sent by the
patched com.iisulauncher.pcbridge.LaunchBridge class. Each connection carries
exactly one launch request; the socket is closed after the payload is sent.

For each request, this:
  1. Parses the component package name and ROM URI out of the Intent dump
     (ROMs travel via ClipData, sent separately as CLIPURI: lines, since
     Intent.toString() only shows a truncated placeholder for ClipData).
  2. Matches the package name against config.json's "emulators" map to find
     a PC emulator (name + fullscreen flag) and searches "search_roots" for
     its executable.
  3. Takes the ROM filename from the end of the URI and looks it up under
     "roms_dir" by matching filename (the patched app can only tell us what
     it knows about its own Android-side content URI, not a Windows path,
     so both sides need to agree on ROM filenames living in roms_dir).
  4. Covers the screen with a fullscreen overlay (boot_overlay.py),
     minimizes the iiSU/AVD window, launches the matching emulator in
     fullscreen, forces it to the foreground, synthesizes a click so
     keyboard/controller input is picked up immediately (Qt apps track
     actual input focus on their render widget, separately from the OS-level
     foreground window), then drops the overlay -- without it, the moment
     between iiSU minimizing and the emulator's window taking over would
     show raw desktop.
  5. Waits for the emulator to exit (either normally, or forced via the
     configured quit_hotkey) and restores the iiSU window (maximized if
     "iisu_fullscreen" is set), mirroring how the real Android launcher
     reappears once a game exits.

All configuration (ROM directory, emulator search paths, package->emulator
mappings, quit hotkey, display settings) lives in config.json next to this
script. Window-management helpers live in winapi.py, shared with
apply_display.py and manager.py. One Python stdlib script, no dependencies.

    RetroArch (com.retroarch) is the one exception: it's a multi-core,
    multi-console frontend on the Android side, and iiSU reports that same
    package for it regardless of which system the game actually is. But
    iiSU also always reports *which core it actually launched with* --
    the intent's LIBRETRO extra (android_core) -- and that's a strictly
    better signal than the ROM's file extension, which can be outright
    wrong: .chd is chdman's container for both PS1 CDs and Dreamcast GD-
    ROMs, and plenty of consoles here share .zip/.7z, so guessing the

    which also means any core this project has never explicitly curated

    A resolved core first checks RETROARCH_CORE_OVERRIDES -- cores with
    their own dedicated, better-suited standalone emulator PC-side (e.g.
    Flycast over RetroArch-with-flycast-core for Dreamcast) -- confirmed

    install (launch_bridge.ensure_retroarch_core downloads it from the
    libretro buildbot if it isn't) -- rather than substituted into one of
    this module's own curated per-extension templates, so this isn't
    limited to consoles/cores someone has explicitly added here.
