"""
Loads bridge/config.json for the other bridge/ scripts.

config.json is created by installer/setup_wizard.py during first-time
setup, it doesn't exist until Setup.bat has been run once. Centralizing
the load here means every entry point (manager.py's Home page and
settings pages, launch_bridge.py, apply_display.py) reports that as a
clear, actionable message instead of each raising its own raw
FileNotFoundError.
